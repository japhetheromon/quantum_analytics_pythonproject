The dataset contains a list of Unicorn Companies Private companies with a valuation over $1 billion as of March 2022, including each company's current valuation, funding, country of origin, industry, select investors, and the years they were founded and became unicorns.

1. Thorough Data cleaning and manipulation was performed on the given dataset
2. Several relationships were created
3. Generated insights from the dataset
4. Performed Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis of the features in the Dataset and compelling visualization to display your insights.
5. Wrote an observation at each of your exploratory data analysis
6. Finally, an overall recommendation to the stakeholders on how they can improve their business and generate more revenue was given.
